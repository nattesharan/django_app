What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java with plugins built for Continuous Integration purpose. 
Jenkins is used to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes
 to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build. It also allows you to continuously deliver your 
 software by integrating with a large number of testing and deployment technologies.

With Jenkins, organizations can accelerate the software development process through automation. Jenkins integrates 
development life-cycle processes of all kinds, including build, document, test, package, stage, deploy, static analysis 
and much more.

1) Installing Jenkins
________________________________

Jenkins is build using java so make sure java is installed
    sudo apt-get install default-jre
    sudo apt-get install default-jdk

After that install Jenkins

    wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
    sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install jenkins

After installing jenkins we need to change the host so follow the steps

    sudo vi /etc/default/jenkins
    Add HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0
    And the restart jenkins 
        sudo service jenkins restart
Now we can see the jenkins interface  on http://HOST:8080/
Open to /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword, copy your password and paste it in the form displayed
install the recommended plugins

After that create a user and then it takes to the dashboard

Dependencies
Jenkins by default do not access git repositories, so we must install a Git plugin. 
Go to the Jenkins server, select the “Manage Jenkins” option and on the next page click on “Manage Plugins”:

Search for github plugin in the available plugins an install the plugin
Select the plugin and click on “Download now and install after restart”

2) Configuring our Job

Now with our Jenkins server installed with the Git plugin, we must configure our job for Jenkins to be able to poll our 
repository for changes.
