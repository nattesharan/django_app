For having the application available over the internet we need to have it running in an external virtual machine.

They are many services which provide a virtual machine. The most popular of them are AWS, Azure and GCP.

Each service has its own way for creating a VM. You can follow their guide for creating an instance(VM).

After creating a virtual machine you can ssh into the VM and setup the respective project on the VM.

They are many ways by which you can ssh into the VM. 

1) If you want to login into an azure vm then it prompts for username and password.
2) Aws provides a .pem file using which you can ssh into the VM.
3) Google does not have any of the above you can ssh from the browser itself.

But there is one way by which we can ssh into all of them without passwords and .pem files.
Instead of .pem files and passwords we will be adding our local machines public key to authorized keys in the VM.

Please follow the below steps in order to add authorized keys to the VM:

1) Firstly login to the VM using the default methods which are mentioned above.

If using GCP can skip the below step-2

2) After logging in create a .ssh dir and file named authorized_keys in the .ssh dir
    Create the ~/.ssh directory and authorized_keys file if they donâ€™t already exist:
        mkdir -p ~/.ssh && touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    Give the ~/.ssh directory and authorized_keys files appropriate file permissions:
        chmod 700 ~/.ssh && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

3) Generate the public key in your machine if it does not exist
        ssh-keygen
    Press Enter to use the default names id_rsa and id_rsa.pub in the /home/your_username/.ssh directory before 
    entering your passphrase (passphrase is not mandatory).
    
    This will create id_rsa.pub in /.ssh/ dir of your machine

4) Copy the content of id_rsa.pub

5) Paste the copied content in authorized_keys of your vm. For AWS and azure this should be file but for GCP you cant
   directly add your key.
   For GCP VM we need to add it in SSH Keys of  metadata.

After following the above steps we can just ssh to the vm with 'ssh username@ip'
