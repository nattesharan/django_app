We start a publisher application that sends a "Hello, World!" message to two subscribers, as illustrated below:


Set up your GCP project and Cloud Pub/Sub topic and subscriptions
________________________________________________________________________
Google Cloud Pub / Sub is a fully-managed real-time messaging service that allows you to send and receive messages 
between independent applications. ... Publisher applications can send messages to a topic and other applications can 
subscribe to that topic to receive the messages.


1) Log into Google Cloud Platform Console.
2) Go to the marketplace and search for pubsub. Click on that
3) Click Create a topic. Publishing applications send messages to topics. Use hello_topic as the Name.
4) Click the topic name, then click Create Subscription:
    Name the subscription sub_one. Do not change any of the default settings. Note that you are creating a 
    StreamingPull subscription, which is a type of pull subscription.

    Use the same procedure to create another subscription attached to hello_topic, named sub_two.

    You can click the topic name in the Topics view to see the new subscriptions or you can change to the Subscriptions view.

At this point, your Cloud Pub/Sub environment is ready to manage message flow between the quickstart's publishing 
and subscribing applications.
