Ansible does configuration management, application deployment, along with infrastructure orchestration.
In ansible, we define what we want to do and ansible go through each and every step for that.


Once upon a time, managing servers reliably and efficiently was a challenge. 
System administrators managed server by hand, installing software manually, changing configuration and managing services 
on servers. As managed servers grew and managed services become more complex, scaling manual process was time-consuming 
and hard. Then came Ansible which is helpful in creating the group of machines, define how to configure them, what action 
to be taken on them. All these configurations and actions can be triggered from a central location which can be your 
local system (named controller machine).

Ansible uses SSH to connect to remote hosts and do the setup, no software needed to be installed beforehand on a remote 
host. It’s simple, agentless, powerful and flexible. It uses YAML in form of ansible playbook. 
Playbook is a file where automation is defined through tasks. A task is a single step to be performed like installing 
a package.

Ansible works by connecting to remote hosts (using SSH) defined in inventory file, which contains information about 
servers to be managed. Ansible then executes defined modules or tasks inside a playbook. 
Execution of playbook which is called the play. We can also use predefined organised playbook called roles, 
which are used for sharing and reusing a provisioning

Terminology which is used in Ansible:
_________________________________________

Controller Machine: Machine where Ansible is installed
Inventory: Information regarding servers to be managed
Playbook: Automation is defined using tasks defined in YAML format
Task: Procedure to be executed
Module: Predefined commands executed directly on remote hosts
Play: Execution of a playbook
Role: a Pre-defined way for organizing playbooks
Handlers: Tasks with unique names that will only be executed if notified by another task


Each playbook is composed of one or more ‘plays’ in a list.
