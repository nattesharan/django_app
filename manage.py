# Permissions
# Assigning permissions to a user grants the user access to do what is described by those permissions. 
# When you create a user, that user has no permissions, and itâ€™s up to you to give the user specific permissions. 
# For example, you can give a user permission to add and change publishers, but not permission to delete them.
# by default when we add a model it creates 3 permissions add, change and delete
# we can also use groups to group multiple permissions
# we check is a user has permission using obj.has_perm('perm') where perm is permission name (here the obj may be group or user)
# like 'app_name.action_model'
# we can alsoadd our own permissions in the model it is a tuple of tuples and then run migration
# if we want to use group we can add permissons to a group and add that group to user
# we can create a manage.py command for populationg the default groups
